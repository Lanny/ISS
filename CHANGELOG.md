# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),

## Unreleased

- Added in-app captchas to replace google recaptcha, because recaptcha is cancer
- Minor updates to default theme and user settings page, chiefly bumping the default text size and giving forms a little more room to breathe

## 1.0.0

Initial versioned release, representing a fully featured piece of performant, low bullshit, well tested forum software built over a decade development, drunkcoding and shitposting. May you use it in the spirit of human community, whatever form that may take.
